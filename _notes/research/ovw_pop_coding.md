- *population vector coding* - ex. neurons coded for direction sum to get final direction
- reduces uncertainty
- *correlation coding* - correlations betweeen spikes carries extra info
- *independent-spike coding* - each spike is independent of other spikes within the spike train
- *position coding* - want to represent a position
  - for grid cells, very efficient
- *sparse coding*
- hard when noise between neurons is correlated
- measures of information


## EDA

- plot neuron responses
- calc neuron covariances
