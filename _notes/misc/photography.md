# pre-editing

1. what do you want it to look like (e.g. dark, scary - bright, energetic)
2. style - e.g. might want lots of contrast
3. who/what/where



# photoshop

- sometimes want to edit in 16-bit, not 8-bit (if getting banding and such)

# portraits

1. photoshop's liquify
2. often useful to slightly darken background and slightly brighten subject

# basics

- rules of thirds: imagine splitting image w/ 2 horizontal + 2 vertical lines - important elements should go on these lines
  - often put person on one line, eyes on top horizontal line, more space in front of them
- want horizontals to be horizontal and verticals to be vertical
